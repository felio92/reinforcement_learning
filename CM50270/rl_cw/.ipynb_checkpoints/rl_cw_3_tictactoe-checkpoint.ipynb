    "## Exercise 1: Tic-Tac-Toe Environment\n",
    "For this exercise, you should implement the game of [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) (also known as Noughts and Crosses). After you have implemented the environment, you will validate it by letting two random agents play against each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Tic-Tac-Toe Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple game for two players, O and X, who take turns marking cells in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in drawing three instances of their symbol in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line wins the game. The following example, from [Wikipedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tic-tac-toe-game-1.svg), shows a game that is won by the X player.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/tic-tac-toe_example.svg\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/> \n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "Implement the game of Tic-Tac-Toe. The first-moving player should be randomly selected at the beginning of each episode. Player X should always be a random agent (i.e. it places an X symbol in a random empty grid-space each time-step). You will implement various agents for player O. Rewards of +1, -1 and 0 should be collected for winning, losing and drawing respectively. All other rewards collected during the game should be 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test your Tic-Tac-Toe implementation by letting two random agents play against each other for 100 episodes. Plot the **cumulative rewards** collected by both the O and X agents as a function of the number of episodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: The X player can be considered to be part of the environment, as it is outside the agent's control.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercises 1, 2, and 4 will be marked jointly; you will see this joint score in Exercise 4. You will be given marks for the strength of your implementation and your understanding of the techniques you have implemented. Please note that the standard implementation of Q-learning will receive at most 8 marks from exercise 3 and 0 marks from exercises 1, 2, and 4. This is the most challenging part of your coursework. Precise instructions are given below.**"
